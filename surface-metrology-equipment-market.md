<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Metrology Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Non-Contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surface metrology equipment is categorized into contact and non-contact types. Contact metrology involves physical interaction with the surface, often using stylus-based instruments that trace the surface profile to measure texture, roughness, and features. This method provides precise data but can risk damaging sensitive surfaces. In contrast, non-contact metrology employs techniques like optical or laser scanning, allowing for large-area measurements without surface contact, thus preserving delicate materials. Both types serve critical roles in quality control across various industries.</p></p>
